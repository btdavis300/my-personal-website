                Born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina, I always had a passion for music. Having my mom as a flutist, and my dad as a drummer, it is no surprise that I would also carry the musician's gene. Ever since I was young, I always wanted to play the drums. My dad had said he wasn’t able to teach me, so I picked up the violin when I was in elementary school. Soon I discovered that I was not good at it and I didn’t feel motivated to practice. After my 15 seconds of fame on a local news segment about the Suzuki strings program I was enrolled in, I soon left the violin. I begged and begged my dad to play the drums, so he found a drum set lesson teacher, Ms. Sue. As soon as I picked up my first pair of drumsticks, I knew this was my calling.

                I joined band in 6th grade, marching band in 7th grade, indoor drumline in 8th grade, and eventually my first drum corps in 11th grade. Essentially defined as a “professional marching band”, Drum Corps International is a rigorous activity with a highly competitive audition process to get accepted. Once you’ve received a contract, you joined up with the drum corps in late May, rehearsal for 12 hours a day for about a month, then hit the road and perform all across the United States. We travelled by bus, slept on gym floors, and spent roughly 90 days on tour. Most of our time was spent outside rehearsing in the heat of summer. It is not for the faint of heart, but the payoff is something you can never get anywhere else. Drum Corps had opened up an entire new world for me. I met some of my best friends, got to see 48 states in the continental US, and was able to showcase all of my hard work to audiences that sometimes expanded over 5,000. I played in the front ensemble, the section at the very foreground of the marching field, playing accessory percussion, xylophone, and eventually marimba. I was fortunate enough to have been a part of drum corps for 5 years, playing in two groups, Carolina Crown, and Santa Clara Vanguard. In 2014, I received the High Drums Award for best percussion section with SCV. I went on to teach a drum corps, The Troopers, from 2016-2019.

                Drum Corps gave me the fuel to pursue music in higher education. I enrolled at the University of South Carolina in 2011 and received my Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance for percussion in 2015. I then went on to graduate school at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas during the fall of 2015 and received my Master of Arts in Music Performance by the end of 2017. I was fortunate enough to have performed at some major conventions during my time in college, performing at the Midwest Band and Orchestra Convention in Chicago in 2016, as well as performing at the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in 2012, 2015, and 2016.

                Texas has brought me a lot of opportunities, both professionally and personally. During my time in Texas, I was a private lesson instructor around the DFW area, most notably as percussion assistant at L.D. Bell High School in Bedford. Shortly after, I became the associate percussion director at L.V. Berkner High School in Richardson. Being a teacher combined my passion for music as well as the fulfillment of public service. Teaching students the craft of music and helping them shape themselves into responsible young adults was something I thought I would never enjoy, but ended up being very fulfilling. In Texas, I also met my wife, who is a social worker and inspiring me everyday to become a better person.

                In the summer of 2022, my wife and I, along with our two cats, will be packing our bags and moving to Denver, Colorado. It is our dream to move further west and into the mile high city. This embarkment brings a new chapter to my life. I enrolled into the Flatiron School of Coding. This website is a product of the knowledge I learned through their prework. I will be joining my cohort in late June 2022 and starting my next chapter in my life. I am so excited to learn about software development. Growing up in the age of the digital world has instilled a love for technology and I cannot wait to further my reach through the digital medium.
